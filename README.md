# todoistScript

---

## Description

This script aims to connect todoist to a local database of SCRUM files written in Markdown.
The idea is simple: 
  1. Write out your personal todo's for the day or week, or start an empty Markdown file with the Sprint title.
  2. The script takes care of synchronizing the work that is in todoist and the SCRUM paper by bringing taks and sending tasks, to and from the markdown file.

# Work Chronology

  - Setting up a connection to take tasks from Todoist into a markdown.
